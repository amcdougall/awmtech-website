Deploying this into Pages in GitHub
  Once the code is in Github - pull code into IntelliJ. 
  Next need to do npm install to make sure that any new libs are pulled into IntelliJ for building.
  Finally run npm run deploy - this will build and deploy the code to gh-pages branch in Github.

  Next check the Github Pages page to see if the settings are still good. 
  Next check the Web-Page out and see if it has launched.
